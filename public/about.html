<h1>About Me</h1>
<p id = "Architect">A fast-learning individual who is
  patient and a good problem-solver.
  Currently enrolled in a Northern
  Arizona University as a work/study
  student. Involved in many years of
  honors programs and participating
  in extracurricular activities such a
  film club.
  </p>

<p id = "Architect">I am currently studying Software Engineering and planning to obtain my Bachelors. I have recently transferred from Glendale Communtiy College with an Associates in Arts. I took part in many honors classes and joined an extracurricular club called the Cinema Society. In that club we made two horror short films that showcased our skills on directing a project. It was an immense amount of fun and both of those films are uploaded on youtube titled "Midnight Hours" and "Liminality". I have worked many jobs including Raising Cane's and Jimmy Johns. I am currently working for Sam's Club in Flagstaff as a part-time employee. My dream job is to either be a Game Designer or a Software Engineer for a huge technology corportation. 
</p>

<p id = "Architect"> On my off time, I like to play video games with friends and watch movies, specifically horror movies. I like to play singleplayer horror games and I love learning all about them. This includes making game development and people's creative design processes. When I am playing with friends however, I like to play shooter games like Rainbow Six Siege. Playing with friends is always so much fun. In terms of movies, I explained about my top 5 movies in my portfolio page, but for a deeper dive I love horror movies and the huge potential with them. I love movies that cover deeper topics that no other creative medium can obtain. Topics of mental health intrigue me as it can cover a wide variety. I hope you found this section interesting to read! </p>
